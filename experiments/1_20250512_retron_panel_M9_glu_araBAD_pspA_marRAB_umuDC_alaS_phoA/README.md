Does retron‑mediated presentation of transcription‑factor binding sites perturb endogenous regulatory networks and induce measurable changes in the fluorescence of candidate TF‑responsive reporters? 
We selected endogenous transcription factors with well‑characterized binding motifs (primarily from DAP‑seq) and, for each, chose the promoter of an operon whose gene showed robust CRISPRi‑mediated differential expression (PPTP‑seq, Han et al. 2023) as having strong priors for knockdown responsiveness.

Grow cells over night either M9-glucose with respective antibiotic(s); Cm and Carb; (1 mL; 24 deep-well microtiter plate)
37 °C air incubator shaking at 250 rpm
Dilute ON cultures (1:200) into pre-culture with respective antibiotic(s); (1 mL; 24 deep-well microtiter plate)
Grow to mid-log phase
Seed exponential cultures into new microtiter plate; back diluting to 0.005-0.025 OD600 into fresh media
Incubate cultures for at least 3 doubling times (~2-3 hours)
Briefly take the plate out to add inducer(s), such as IPTG 1x, arabinose, etc. 
Grow cells over time and measure OD600 and relative fluorescent units (YFP/CFP)
